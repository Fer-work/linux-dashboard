# DevOps Dashboard

To practice for an upcoming role, I built this mini DevOps dashboard using Oracle VirtualBox running Ubuntu in order to get familiar with this OS. The app is built using Node.js, Express, and EJS. It displays real-time system stats and simulates monitoring and alerting functionality. I also set it up in a virtualized environment to mirror a real-world server, and I'm currently working on integrating logging, availability checks, and potentially deploying it via Docker or cloud. I wanted something tangible to explore the diagnostic and support aspects of the role.
